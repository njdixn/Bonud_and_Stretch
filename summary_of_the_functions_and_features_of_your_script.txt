A summary of the functions and features of your script

For this assignment, I chose to create the classic game of Tic Tac Toe where the player competes against the computer. I wanted to be able to see the progress of the game in real time as each move is made. In a previous assignment for BNH, I tried to achieve something similar, but without the ability to use functions, it wasn’t possible. For this project, I used the setTimeout() function to allow the board to update visually after each turn.

In this version, X and O are already assigned from the start, with the user always playing as X and going first. The game uses a 3×3 grid, with each square numbered 1 through 9. As the player enters their moves through prompts, the board updates on the screen to show the current state. After each turn, the script checks whether either player has won by evaluating all possible winning combinations, and also checks whether there are any empty cells remaining to detect a draw. The computer then chooses a random empty square for its move, and the process repeats until someone wins or the board is full. Organizing the game into small functions for rendering the board, handling input, checking for wins, and alternating turns helped make the code structured, readable, and allowed the game to run interactively. Overall, this project gave me a chance to combine logic, DOM manipulation, and timing functions to create a playable, real-time game experience.
